        <h3>For the Frosting and Topping</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4oz cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>4 Tbsp unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>t tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li> cup confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>2/3 cup coarsely chopped pecans</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9" round
                springform pan with cooking spray and set aside.</li>
            <li>First, make the cheesecake mixture: in the bowl of a 
                stand mixer, cream together the cream cheese,
                granulated sugar and flour together with the paddle
                attachment until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute.
                Scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl. Add in the eggs, one 
                at a time, followed by the vanilla extract and sour cream,
                mixing well. Scrape down the bottom and sides of the
                bowl as needed. Mixture will be thin. Forecefully tap the 
                bowl against the countertop for about 30 taps to pop 
                any air bubbles. Set aside.</li>
            <li>For the carrot cake mixture: In a large bowl, whisk
                together the vegetable oil, crushed pineapple, 
                granulated sugar, brown sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract
                together until combined, about 30 seconds. Add in the
                spices, flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt and
                whisk until just barely combined but still streaks of flour 
                remain. Lastly, fold in the grated carrots and chopped
                pecans and fold in until ocmbined. Tap this bowl
                forcefully against the countertop about 30 taps to pop 
                any air bubbles as well.</li>
            <li>For assembly: First, pour about 1Â½ cups of the carrot 
                cake batter into the bottom of the greased springform 
                pan and spread into an even layer. Then, add about 1/2 
                of the cheesecake mixture in dollops. Do not spread or 
                swirl. Next, add the remaining carrot cake batter, 
                followed by the remaining dollops of cheesecake batter. 
                Resist the urge to spread or swirl. I like to dollop the 
                cheesecake batter on rather than pour it on in one big 
                glob; it covers more evenly this way.</li>
            <li>Bake for 60-65 minutes or until done (if the center jiggles 
                very slightly, that is alright). I recommend tenting the pan 
                around the 40-minute mark with foil to prevent from excessive 
                browning of the cheesecake. Cool for about 1 hour, then cover
                 with plastic wrap or foil and refrigerate for about 6 hours, 
                 or overnight, before frosting.</li>
            <li>For the frosting: In a medium bowl, beat together the cream 
                cheese, butter, and vanilla extract together with a handheld 
                electric mixer until smooth. Add in the confectioners' sugar 
                and mix until combined.</li>
            <li>Spread the frosting evenly over the cheesecake. Garnish the 
                rim of the frosted cheesecake with chopped pecans. Store any 
                leftover cheesecake in the fridge.</li>
        </ol>
